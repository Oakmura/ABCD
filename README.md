 ## ABCD Engine - Educational Exploration of Hazel

**Disclaimer:**

This ABCD engine is a learning project intended for my educational purposes only. It is a clone of the Hazel engine, aiming to explore and understand its inner workings.

**Changes:**

While ABCD initially replicates Hazel's functionality, I plan to introduce some deviations from the original work. These may include:

-   Integration with libraries or frameworks not used in Hazel.
-   Project structure.
-   Coding style.
-   et al.
